 Conference Track @27th IEEE WETICE Conference
 Paris, France, June 27-29, 2018
==========================================================


CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

Over the course of the last years, currently emerging Web 3.0 environments have provided a strong potential for the integration of data sources, applications and tools. In such a pervasive and highly dynamic scenario, existing techniques for accessing and managing web content seem to be actually inadequate to satisfy the user needs. More implicit and automatic ways of exploring data information are needed to improve the usability of web resources. 
These challenges are not limited to enhance information retrieval, but aims to raise awareness of how such information can be put to use in order to transform a specific dataset into a particularly significant resource when used in conjunction with other sources of information, also raising several important challenges for future data and web mining methods.

The goal of the Data Exploration in the Web 3.0 Age (DEW 2018) IEEE track is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the areas related to data exploration, in a very broad sense. The track welcomes contributions from data mining, query languages, data visualization, graph databases and other fields related to the analysis and exploitation of data. Papers focusing on Semantic technologies and Graph databases are particularly welcome.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
==================

Any work related to data exploration is welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  * Text and Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery
  * Faceted Search and Browsing
  * Information Retrieval
  * Data Visualization and UX for Web 3.0 data
  * Querying interfaces and languages including Constrained natural languages
  * Entity Recognition and merging, Type classification, record linkage and property ranking
  * Privacy and Security issues in Data Exploration
  * Machine learning and statistical methods for natural language and Web 3.0 data
  * Platforms and Applications exploring data in all domains including social, web, bioinformatics and finance
  * Knowledge graph creation, reasoning, and exploration
  * Data streams and the Internet of Things
  * Semantic Web and Linked Data analytics
