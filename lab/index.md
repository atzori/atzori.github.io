The [Semantic Web Lab](https://swlab.unica.it/) is mainly devoted to the design, analysis and experimentation of algorithms and systems involving Big structured and unstructured Data for the Web, such as knowledge graphs, massive textual data, web and source code repositories.
Our effort is particularly focused on automating or simplifying access to these resources with innovative query systems, such as Question Answering over Linked Data, Machine Reading, SPARQL extensions and our By-Example Structured Query approach.
