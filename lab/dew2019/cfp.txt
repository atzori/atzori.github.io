 Conference Track @28th IEEE WETICE Conference
 Capri Island (Naples), Italy, June 12-14, 2019

Paper submission deadline (extended): March 12th, 2019 

CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

Currently emerging Web 3.0 environments have provided a strong potential for the integration of data sources, applications and tools. In such a pervasive and highly dynamic scenario, existing techniques for accessing and managing web content seem to be actually inadequate to satisfy the user needs and more automatic ways of exploring, joining and sharing information are needed to improve the usability of web resources.

This raises several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. Such challenges range from the analysis of poorly structured information, such as annotations and tags, to the provision of intelligent methods that support users in searching and integrating information offered by web resources. The overall goal of these challenges is not limited to enhance information retrieval but also includes exploiting the enriched semantics a dataset acquires when used in conjunction with other sources of information. The synergy of different technologies, including semantic web, natural language search, machine learning, recommendation agents and artificial intelligence, can be especially fruitful in this perspective.

The goal of the Data Exploration in the Web 3.0 Age (DEW 2019) IEEE track is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the areas related to data exploration, in a very broad sense. The track welcomes contributions from data mining, query languages, data visualization, graph databases and other fields related to the analysis and exploitation of data. Papers focusing on Semantic technologies and Graph databases are particularly welcome.

Best papers from previous editions of the DEW track were invited/published at Information Journal (2018) and Future Generation Computer Systems Journal (2019). 


TOPICS OF INTEREST
==================

Any work related to data exploration is welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  * Text and Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery
  * Faceted Search and Browsing
  * Information Retrieval
  * Data Visualization and UX for Web 3.0 data
  * Querying interfaces and languages including Constrained natural languages
  * Entity Recognition and merging, Type classification, record linkage and property ranking
  * Privacy and Security issues in Data Exploration
  * Machine learning and statistical methods for natural language and Web 3.0 data
  * Platforms and Applications exploring data in all domains including social, web, bioinformatics and finance
  * Knowledge graph creation, reasoning, and exploration
  * Data streams and the Internet of Things
  * Semantic Web and Linked Data analytics

  
SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS
===========================

Papers up to six (6) double-column pages (including figures, tables and references) should contain original contributions not published or submitted elsewhere and are to be formatted according to the IEEE template provided at the DEW 2019 website. Technical paper authors MUST submit their manuscripts through EasyChair in PDF format.
Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press in a volume available under IEEE Digital Library. The proceedings will be submitted for indexing through INSPEC, Compendex, Thomson Reuters, DBLP, Google Scholar and EI Index, and available in both Elsevier Scopus and ISI Web of Science databases.
Distinguished quality papers presented at the DEW 2019 will be also selected for publication in internationally renowned journals.
